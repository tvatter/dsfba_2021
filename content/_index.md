## Aim of the course

The aim of this course is to learn the most important tools to use data science in a business context, and includes concepts from statistics and computer science:

> Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, 
> you'll learn how to clean data and draw plots and many other things besides. 
> These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will 
> find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. 
> You'll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, 
> and reproducible research to save time. 
> You'll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries 
> when wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data. 
> <cite> Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham </cite>
