## Course Readings

There will be no mandatory reading. However, weekly readings related to the
[lectures](/dsfba_2021/lectures/) are strongly recommended, 
and [additional ressources](/dsfba_2021/ressources/) 
will undoubtedly be useful.

## Evaluation

Evaluation will be based on assignments and a final project. 
For each assignment as well as the project, students will have to provide code and/or detailed written reports. Additionally, students will produce a video presentation of their project.

### Retake exam

The retake consists in asking the failing students to do a new final project and 
present it.
