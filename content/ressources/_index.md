## Getting started with R and Rstudio

#### [The CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/)

CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, 
up-to-date, versions of R and its documentation. 

#### [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)

This official and up-to-date tutorial, gives an introduction to the language 
and how to use R for doing statistical analysis and graphics.	

#### [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 
It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code 
execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace 
management. 

#### [Rstudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

A trove of cheat sheets below to make it easy to learn about and use some of 
R's most useful packages.

#### [R packages for data science](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data 
science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and 
data structures. 

## Books

#### [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)

> The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their 
> programming skills and understanding of the language. 
> It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, 
> as it explains some of Râ€™s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible 
> do have a positive side.
> <cite> Hadley Wickham </cite>

#### [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

> This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You'll learn how to 
> get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, 
> visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills 
> for data science. 
> <cite> Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham </cite>

#### [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown)

> The document format "R Markdown" was first introduced in the knitr package 
> (Xie 2015, 2020c) in early 2012. The idea was to embed code chunks (of R or 
> other languages) in Markdown documents. In fact, knitr supported several 
> authoring languages from the beginning in addition to Markdown, including 
> LaTeX, HTML, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, and Textile. Looking back over the 
> five years, it seems to be fair to say that Markdown has become the most 
> popular document format, which is what we expected.
> <cite> Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund </cite>


## Online learning

#### [Coding club's tutorials](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/)

> Our mission is to create a fun and supportive environment where we develop programming and statistics skills together, using R. 
> 
> We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn, and here we will share our experience.

#### [Datacamp's free R tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) and [Try R by Code School](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)

Both sites provide interactive lessons that will get you writing real code in minutes. They are a great place to make mistakes and test out new skills. You are told immediately when you go wrong and given a chance to fix your code.

#### [Writing functions in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r)

This course will teach you the fundamentals of writing functions in R so that, among other things, you can make your code more readable, avoid coding errors, and automate repetitive tasks.

#### [Introduction to the tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse)

This is an introduction to the dplyr and ggplot2 packages through exploration and visualization of country data over time. 
This is a suitable course for people who have no or limited experience in R and are interested in learning to perform data analysis.

#### [Data visualisation with ggplot2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1)

Covers the basics of ggplot2. 
Followed by part 2 which covers more advanced topics.

#### [Exploratory data analysis in R: a case study](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-r-case-study) 

This course brings ggplot2 and dplyr into action in an in-depth analysis of 
United Nations voting data. The course also introduces broom for tidying 
model output and the tidyr package for wrangling data into an explorable shape.

## Misc

#### [Easy web applications in R](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/)

Shiny is an open source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web 
framework for building web applications using R. 
Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications without 
requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.

#### [Rcpp for Seamless R and C++ Integration](http://www.rcpp.org/)

The Rcpp package has become the most widely used language extension for R, 
the powerful environment and language for computing with data. 
As of May 2017, 1026 packages on CRAN and a further 91 on BioConductor 
deploy Rcpp to extend R, to accelerate computations and to connect to other 
C++ projects.
