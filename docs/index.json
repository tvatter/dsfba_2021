	"content": "For this assignment, you will work on a real data science project. The goal of the project is to go through the complete data science process to answer questions you have about some topic of your own choosing. You will acquire the data, design your visualizations, run statistical analysis, and communicate the results.\nProject Milestones There are a few milestones for your final project.\n   Date Assignment Link to submit     10/17 Project proposal Fill this form   11/14 Project update Fill this form   12/15 Final Report    12/15 Video presentation     Note that:\n No extensions will be given for any of the project due dates except for medical reasons. Projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.  Project proposal The proposal should be received by October 17, 2021.\n The title can be changed at a later date. Each team (or individual if working alone) only needs to submit one proposal. At this stage, we reserve the right to reject a project proposal if it is not judged satisfactory. But the goal is mostly to set you on a path to succeed! Fill this form You can use this template and then just copy-paste sections in the form when you are ready.  Project udpate The update should be received by November 14, 2021.\n Make sure that the title is final at this points. Each team (or individual if working alone) only needs to submit one update. At this stage, we reserve the right to schedule a meeting to provide additional guidance if the update is not judged satisfactory. Fill this form You can use this template.  Final report The final report is composed of two parts:\n RMarkdown and compiled HTML files describe the project in details. The slides from your presentation.  RMarkdown and compiled HTML The most important deliverable of your project is the set of RMarkdown and compiled HTML files by December 15, 2021. They should detail your steps in developing your solution, including how you collected the data, alternative solutions you tried, describing statistical methods you used, and the insights you got. Equally important to your final results is how you got there! Your RMarkdown and HTML files are the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. We strongly advise you to include many visualizations.\nYour RMarkdown should include the following topics. Depending on your project type, the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:\n  Overview and Motivation: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.\n  Related Work: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a website, or something we discussed in class.\n  Initial Questions: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?\n  Data: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.\n  Exploratory Analysis: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?\n  Modeling: What are the different statistical methods you considered? Why did you choose a given model? How about competing approaches?\n  Final Analysis: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?\n  As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your RMarkdown file and compiled HTML file are standalone documents that fully describe your process and results. For instructions on how to submit, please see Submission Instructions below.\nAs a side note, the following scale will be used to grade projects:\n Overview, motivation, related work, research questions: 10/100 Data sources and description: 10/100 Exploratory data analysis: 35/100 Answering the research questions and final analysis: 35/100 Aesthetics, english writing, project organization, code quality: 10/100 Additionally, you have the opportunity to earn bonuses of up to 20/100 (e.g., by using interactive visualization or presenting your work in especially interesting ways, for instance by complementing your report with a website generated with markdown).  Code We expect you to write high-quality and readable R code in your RMarkdown file. You should strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reproducibility, efficiency, cleaning data, etc. We also expect you to document your code.\nVideo presentation Each team will prepare a seven minutes video presentation showing a demo of your project and/or some slides.\nWe will strictly enforce the time limit, so please make sure you are not running longer. Use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across. Focus the majority of your presentation on your main contributions rather than on technical details. What do you feel is the best part of your project? What insights did you gain? What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away? Make sure it is upfront and center rather than at the end.\nWe use the following criteria to evaluate oral presentations:\n Content (4/20) Organization (4/20) Teamwork (4/20, project done individually automatically earn the 4 points) Visuals (4/20) Presentation mechanics (4/20)  A link with a video should be submitted on December 15, 2021, and slides should be submitted by the same day. For instructions on how to submit, please see Submission Instructions below.\nSubmission Instructions How to submit the project proposal (due October 17, 2021)  Fill this form  How to submit the project udpate (due November 14, 2021)  Fill this form  How to submit the data, RMarkdown and compiled HTML files (due December 15, 2021) TBA\nHow to submit the presentation slides and video link (due December 15, 2021) TBA\nGrading  The project proposal is worth 10% of the overall course grade. The project update is worth 10% of the overall course grade. The report and the presentation represent 80% of the overall course grade:  60% for your RMarkdown files and the knitted report. This includes the quality of your data analysis and R code, the complexity and level of difficulty of your project, completeness and overall functionality of your analysis. 20% for your presentation and the quality of its storytelling aspects.

	"content": "Getting started with R and Rstudio The CRAN website CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of R and its documentation.\nAn Introduction to R This official and up-to-date tutorial, gives an introduction to the language and how to use R for doing statistical analysis and graphics.\nRStudio RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.\nRstudio cheat sheets A trove of cheat sheets below to make it easy to learn about and use some of R\u0026rsquo;s most useful packages.\nR packages for data science The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.\nBooks Advanced R  The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language. It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as it explains some of R’s quirks and shows how some parts that seem horrible do have a positive side. Hadley Wickham  R for Data Science  This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham  R Markdown: The Definitive Guide  The document format \u0026ldquo;R Markdown\u0026rdquo; was first introduced in the knitr package (Xie 2015, 2020c) in early 2012. The idea was to embed code chunks (of R or other languages) in Markdown documents. In fact, knitr supported several authoring languages from the beginning in addition to Markdown, including LaTeX, HTML, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, and Textile. Looking back over the five years, it seems to be fair to say that Markdown has become the most popular document format, which is what we expected. Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund  Online learning Coding club\u0026rsquo;s tutorials  Our mission is to create a fun and supportive environment where we develop programming and statistics skills together, using R.\nWe want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn, and here we will share our experience.\n Datacamp\u0026rsquo;s free R tutorial and Try R by Code School Both sites provide interactive lessons that will get you writing real code in minutes. They are a great place to make mistakes and test out new skills. You are told immediately when you go wrong and given a chance to fix your code.\nWriting functions in R This course will teach you the fundamentals of writing functions in R so that, among other things, you can make your code more readable, avoid coding errors, and automate repetitive tasks.\nIntroduction to the tidyverse This is an introduction to the dplyr and ggplot2 packages through exploration and visualization of country data over time. This is a suitable course for people who have no or limited experience in R and are interested in learning to perform data analysis.\nData visualisation with ggplot2 Covers the basics of ggplot2. Followed by part 2 which covers more advanced topics.\nExploratory data analysis in R: a case study This course brings ggplot2 and dplyr into action in an in-depth analysis of United Nations voting data. The course also introduces broom for tidying model output and the tidyr package for wrangling data into an explorable shape.\nMisc Easy web applications in R Shiny is an open source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R. Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.\nRcpp for Seamless R and C++ Integration The Rcpp package has become the most widely used language extension for R, the powerful environment and language for computing with data. As of May 2017, 1026 packages on CRAN and a further 91 on BioConductor deploy Rcpp to extend R, to accelerate computations and to connect to other C++ projects.\n"

NEXT DEADLINE: use this link to fill your project proposal by NOVEMBER 14TH.  You can use this template.    Aim of the course The aim of this course is to learn the most important tools to use data science in a business context, and includes concepts from statistics and computer science:\n Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to clean data and draw plots and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You\u0026rsquo;ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data. Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham  The course will cover the following topics:\n Program  Data structures Control flows Functions   Explore  Data visualization Data transformation Exploratory data analysis   Wrangle  Tidy data Relational data Strings, factors, dates and times   Communicate  Literate programming Graphics for communication    As the class will be hands-on and centered around data, bringing your laptop to lectures and exercise sessions is recommended.\n"
